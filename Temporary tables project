1) Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT artist_name,avg(popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData 
GROUP BY artist_name
)
SELECT  artist_name, average_popularity,'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90; 

2) Let's say you work as a data analyst for your city, and your boss wants a list of all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher. She also wants to see the average safety rating for each of those bike lanes, and a label that says "Safe Lane".
WITH safety_average_cte AS (
SELECT street, avg(safetyrating) rating
FROM CityBikeLanes
GROUP BY street)
SELECT rating,street, 'safe lane' as 'label'
FROM safety_average_cte
WHERE rating >=4;
